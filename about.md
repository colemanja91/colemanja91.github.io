You've found my blog thing!

## Cat

This was my cat, Frank. If we've worked together, you've probably seen him on a Zoom call. Frank unfortunately passed away in June 2024.

## Personal

Hi! My name is Allie. I'm a generalist who likes to solve problems. I've historically help data analytics, software engineering, and product management roles. Now I'm trying to do something different with my career.

[My non-professional blog](https://alliec.substack.com/?utm_source=github), where I write about theology and faith.
